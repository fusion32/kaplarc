#Storage
* Local Storage
	- Involves serialization of objects that would rather be saved into the database. These are closely tied to the current version of the server so it's only purpose is to prevent data loss in case of network isolation.

* Cassandra DB
	- Will be the main database backend. Involves direct communication to the cluster.

* PostgreSQL
	- Will be implemented later on as it requires some reading. Not that it is complicated but one database backend is really enough for now and i have already spent some time reading about Cassandra.


# Data Model
* Denormalization
	- Table joins are quite expensive, and also not supported by Cassandra, so denormalization should be required.
