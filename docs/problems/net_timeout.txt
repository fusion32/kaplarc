PROBLEM:
	- its possible to make an infinite number of idle connections

SOLUTION 1:
	- perform a timeout routine every TIMEOUT seconds and discard
	the inactive connections
	- iterating over the connection linked list might be slow but
	with the current (IOCP) connection structure it wouldn't make
	a diference even if it was an array

SOLUTION 2:
	- try to find a better overall solution while rewriting the epoll backend
