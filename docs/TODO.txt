- improve output message pool
- divide the map into sectors
- divide the server into shards
	-- each shard will manage one or more map sectors and will have a single dispatcher
	-- the shards together will form a cluster
	-- there must be a shard communication/transfer protocol

- always leave callback lambdas empty after a call:
			[shared](...){ callback(std::move(shared), ...); }
		or	[shared](...){ callback(shared, ...); shared.reset(); }
	(shared == nullptr) would evaluate true after the first call
- connections have one read and one write operation at a time so having a way to reuse the memory
	for the operations would improve the performance:
		async_accept(socket, newsocket, callback, opdata);
		async_read(socket, buffer, callback, opdata);
		async_write(socket, buffer, callback, opdata);
- configure .clang-format to actually start using it (even if it doesn't correctly support pointer
	alignment to the right yet)
