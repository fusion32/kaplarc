- improve output message pool
- came to know that most implementations of std::map and std::set use red-black trees as the
	underlying tree so it might be better to use std::set instead of the AVLTree for the
	scheduler as red-black trees have better performance when inserting/removing often
	but it still needs to be measured whether or not it would improve its performance
- until the Networking TS is not merged into the c++ standard, should consider using ASIO
	library as it would prevent more unexpected bugs
- add variable capacity to dispatchers (requires a dynamic capacity ringbuffer)
- divide the map into sectors with each sector having it's own dispatcher and effectively
	having better multithreaded performance without the need of locking
	-- edge problem: essentialy try to keep a whole zone within a sector and if the zone is
		too big and you need to split the zone in two, make so people from one sector are
		phased from the people of the other sector
- every platform i'm targeting here has an async io, timer, and event mechanism:
	- linux: epoll has eventfd, timerfd, and io
	- bsd: kqueue has user events, timers and io
	- win32: iocp has user events and io (need to check for timers)
